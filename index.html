          If there are things your dog shouldn’t eat, why would they be included
          in dog food? Most often, fillers are the culprit! Dog food companies
          need to meet a certain protein requirement and will add fillers to
          meet it. This may sound okay, but in reality, this protein filler does
          not add anything to the nutritional value. Filler can also be added
          for texture or density to make the food seem healthier to the
          consumer. These ingredients can be just plain unhealthy. Current
          research is bringing to light that many of these unhealthy ingredients
          can trigger allergies in your dog.

          BHA, or Butylated Hydroxyanisole, is a chemical preservative found in
          many dog foods and treats. It is used to preserve fats and oils. BHA
          has been listed by the CDC as a known carcinogen that has negative
          effects on the liver and kidneys of animals. It is actually banned in
          some countries but is currently allowed in small quantities by the
          United States. Unfortunately, if your dog’s food has just a small
          amount, but they are being fed this food every day, BHA can pose a
          real threat to your dog’s health.
